# 1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank
Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.

He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.

Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.
Example 3:

Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000

Today's @LeetCode POTD — “Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank” 💰

Hercy saves money every day for his dream car 🚗
Let’s understand how his pattern of saving becomes a neat little math puzzle 👇

Tweet 2:
📅 Every week has 7 days.

On Monday, Hercy starts with $1.

Each next day, he adds $1 more than the day before.

Each new Monday, he increases his starting amount by $1 compared to last week.

So the pattern looks like:
Week1 → 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
Week2 → 2,3,4,5,6,7,8
and so on…

To find the total after n days 👇

1️⃣ Break the total days into full weeks (n // 7) and leftover days (n % 7).
2️⃣ For each week, the start amount increases by +1.
3️⃣ Add the 7-day sum each time, then handle the leftover days for the last week.

That’s it — pure math & loops 🔁

✨ Logic in plain words:

“Keep adding week by week, starting one dollar higher each Monday — and count how many days are left for the last partial week.”

The trick is balancing week increments + day increments together!

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        int start = 1;

        while (n > 0) {
            int days = min(n, 7);
            for (int i = 0; i < days; i++)
                ans += start + i;
            start++;
            n -= days;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
