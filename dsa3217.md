# 3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array
You are given an array of integers nums and the head of a linked list. Return the head of the modified linked list after removing all nodes from the linked list that have a value that exists in nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], head = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: [4,5]

Explanation:



Remove the nodes with values 1, 2, and 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], head = [1,2,1,2,1,2]

Output: [2,2,2]

Explanation:



Remove the nodes with value 1.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5], head = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [1,2,3,4]

Explanation:



No node has value 5.

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
All elements in nums are unique.
The number of nodes in the given list is in the range [1, 105].
1 <= Node.val <= 10^5
The input is generated such that there is at least one node in the linked list that has a value not present in nums.

### Day104 of #LearningInPublic 🚀
Today's @LeetCode POTD — “Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array”

We’re given:
✔ An array of values to remove
✔ A linked list
Goal → Delete all nodes from the list whose values exist in that array.

###  2:
🧠 Think of it like this:
You have a guest list (array).
You have people standing in a line (linked list).
Anyone whose name is in the “not allowed” list → remove from the line.
Keep the rest in the same order. Simple!

###  3:
💡 How we solve it (super beginner-friendly logic):

First, sort the array or store it so we can quickly check if a value should be removed.

Now walk through the linked list from start to end.

If the node’s value is not in the array → keep it.
If it is in the array → skip it.

At the end, return the cleaned-up list. ✅

###  4:
📌 Example:
nums = [1,2,3]
list = 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5

Remove 1, 2, 3 because they’re in nums.
Final list = 4 → 5

Same process for all test cases. No magic, just smart filtering!

### 5 (Closing):
✨ This problem teaches:
✔ Efficient searching (like binary search / sets)
✔ Linked list traversal
✔ Dummy node trick for clean logic

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* modifiedList(vector<int>& valuesToRemove, ListNode* head) {        
        sort(valuesToRemove.begin(), valuesToRemove.end());
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode* tail = dummy;
        while (head != nullptr){            
            if (!binary_search(valuesToRemove.begin(), valuesToRemove.end(), head->val)) {
                tail->next = head;
                tail = tail->next;
            }
            head = head->next;
        }
        tail->next = nullptr;
        return dummy->next;
    }
