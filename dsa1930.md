# 1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences
Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
Example 2:

Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
Example 3:

Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists of only lowercase English letters.

        for(int i=0;i<n-2;i++){
            char ch=s[i];
            if(st.find(ch)!=st.end()) continue;
            st.insert(ch);
            unordered_set<char> temp;
            int idx=-1;
            for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++){
                if(s[j]==ch) idx=j;
            }
            for(int j=i+1;j<idx;j++){
                temp.insert(s[j]);
            }
            ans+=temp.size();
        }
        return ans;
    }
