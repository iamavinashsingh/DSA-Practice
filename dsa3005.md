# 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency

You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.

The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency
A very simple but tricky counting problem. Let’s break it down 🧵👇

Tweet 2
We’re given an array of numbers.
👉 Each number has a frequency (how many times it appears).
👉 We need the total count of all numbers that appear the most.

🔹 Example 1: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]

Frequency(1) = 2

Frequency(2) = 2

Frequency(3) = 1

Frequency(4) = 1

Max frequency = 2 → Elements with this frequency = {1, 2}
So total = 2 + 2 = 4 ✅

Tweet 4
🔹 Example 2: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Here every element appears once.
👉 Max frequency = 1
👉 All 5 elements have this frequency
So answer = 1+1+1+1+1 = 5 ✅

Tweet 5 (Intuition 🤔)
The trick is:

Count frequencies of all numbers.

Find the maximum frequency.

Add up all counts of numbers having that frequency.

That’s it 🎯

Easy observation → frequency map + max frequency check 👌
One of those problems where brute-force thinking already leads to the correct approach.

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequencyElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        int frequency = 0, count = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }

        for (auto& pair : freq) {
            if (pair.second == frequency) {
                count++;
            } else if (pair.second > frequency) {
                frequency = pair.second;
                count = 1;
            }
        }

        return frequency * count;
    }
};
```
