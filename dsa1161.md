# 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.
Example 2:

Input: root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLevelSum(TreeNode* root) {
        queue<TreeNode*>q;
        q.push(root);
        int level=0;
        int mx= INT_MIN;
        int level_number;
        while(q.size()){
            int k=q.size();
            level++;
            int sum=0;
            while(k--){
                auto x =q.front();
                q.pop();
                sum+=x->val;
                if(x->left!=NULL){
                    q.push(x->left);
                }
                if(x->right!=NULL){
                    q.push(x->right);
                }
            }
            if(mx<sum){
                mx=sum;
                level_number=level;
            }
        }
        return level_number;
    }
