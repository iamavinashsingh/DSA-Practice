# 1518. Water Bottles
There are numBottles water bottles that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty water bottles from the market with one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Given the two integers numBottles and numExchange, return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

 

Example 1:


Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
Example 2:


Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
 

Constraints:

1 <= numBottles <= 100
2 <= numExchange <= 100

1/ Imagine you have numBottles full bottles of water.
Every time you finish one, you get an empty bottle.
Now, the shopkeeper lets you trade numExchange empty bottles for 1 full bottle.

How many total bottles can you drink? 💧

2/ Key insight:
Every full bottle = 1 drink.
Every empty bottle = a chance to recycle into a new drink.

So we keep drinking, collecting empties, and trading them in until we don’t have enough for another exchange. 🔄

3/ Example 1:
Start: 9 bottles 🍶
Drink all → 9 empty
Exchange 9/3 = 3 new bottles
Drink → +3 = 12 total
Now 3 empties → 1 new bottle
Drink → +1 = 13 total ✅

4/ Example 2:
Start: 15 bottles
Drink all → 15 empties
Exchange 15/4 = 3 new bottles
Drink → total = 18
Now 3 empties + leftover → trade 1 more
Drink → 19 total ✅

5/ The process is simple:

Drink → collect empties

Trade empties for new bottles

Repeat until you can’t trade anymore

The trick? Keep track of both new bottles gained and leftover empties.

6/ Why this problem matters ⚡
It teaches greedy simulation:

Always maximize the immediate benefit (exchange whenever possible).

No DP/complex math needed.

Just simulate carefully until stuck.

7/ This is a classic resource exchange problem.
Think about soda cans, reward points, or even loyalty cards 🛒.
If you can recycle/trade something for more, keep doing it until the system blocks you.

8/ Final Thought 💡
Greedy strategies often feel “too simple”… but in problems like this, that’s exactly the beauty.

Once you frame it as:
👉 Drink → Empty → Exchange → Repeat
…the problem solves itself.

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int ans = numBottles;
        int empty = numBottles;

        while (empty >= numExchange) {
            int newBottles = empty / numExchange;
            ans += newBottles;
            empty = newBottles + (empty % numExchange);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};

```
