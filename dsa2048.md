# 2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number
An integer x is numerically balanced if for every digit d in the number x, there are exactly d occurrences of that digit in x.

Given an integer n, return the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than n.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 22
Explanation: 
22 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 2 occurs 2 times. 
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1000
Output: 1333
Explanation: 
1333 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
- The digit 3 occurs 3 times. 
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1000.
Note that 1022 cannot be the answer because 0 appeared more than 0 times.
Example 3:

Input: n = 3000
Output: 3133
Explanation: 
3133 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
- The digit 3 occurs 3 times.
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 3000.
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 10^6

Today's @LeetCode POTD: "Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number" (2048)

Let’s break it down simply 👇

💡 What's the problem?
A number is numerically balanced if each digit d appears exactly d times.

For example:

22 → digit 2 appears twice ✅

1333 → 1 appears once, 3 appears thrice ✅

We need to find the smallest numerically balanced number greater than n.

🧠 Core Idea:
Start from n + 1 and check each number until we find one that’s “balanced”.

How do we check if a number is balanced?
👉 Count frequency of each digit
👉 For every digit d, ensure its count == d
👉 If any count exceeds its digit, discard early (for efficiency)

⚙️ Optimization trick:
Instead of overthinking the generation logic — a simple frequency-based validation works perfectly within given constraints (n ≤ 10^6).
It’s brute force… but beautifully sufficient 😌

✨ Examples:

Input: 1 → Output: 22

Input: 1000 → Output: 1333

Input: 3000 → Output: 3133

Pattern?
The next balanced number grows intuitively, matching digits with their counts.

🔍 Learning:
Sometimes, the best solution isn’t the smartest-looking one — it’s the one that fits the limits and works cleanly.
Simplicity wins again! 💪

🚀 Key Takeaway:
Don’t fear brute force — optimize where it matters.
Even a direct approach shines when constraints are kind.

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
bool balanced(int n ){

    int a[10] = {0};
    while(n){
        int x = n%10;
        a[x]+=1;
        n = n/10;
        if(a[x] > x) return false;
    }
    for(int i =0;i<=9;i++){
        if(a[i]!=i && a[i]!=0){
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
    
}
int nextBeautifulNumber(int n) {
    n+=1;
     while(n<=INT_MAX){
        if(balanced(n)){
            return n;
        }
        n+=1;
    }
    return -1;
    
}
};
```
