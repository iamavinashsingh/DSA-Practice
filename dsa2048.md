# 2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number
An integer x is numerically balanced if for every digit d in the number x, there are exactly d occurrences of that digit in x.

Given an integer n, return the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than n.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 22
Explanation: 
22 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 2 occurs 2 times. 
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1000
Output: 1333
Explanation: 
1333 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
- The digit 3 occurs 3 times. 
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 1000.
Note that 1022 cannot be the answer because 0 appeared more than 0 times.
Example 3:

Input: n = 3000
Output: 3133
Explanation: 
3133 is numerically balanced since:
- The digit 1 occurs 1 time.
- The digit 3 occurs 3 times.
It is also the smallest numerically balanced number strictly greater than 3000.
 

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 10^6

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
bool balanced(int n ){

    int a[10] = {0};
    while(n){
        int x = n%10;
        a[x]+=1;
        n = n/10;
        if(a[x] > x) return false;
    }
    for(int i =0;i<=9;i++){
        if(a[i]!=i && a[i]!=0){
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
    
}
int nextBeautifulNumber(int n) {
    n+=1;
     while(n<=INT_MAX){
        if(balanced(n)){
            return n;
        }
        n+=1;
    }
    return -1;
    
}
};
