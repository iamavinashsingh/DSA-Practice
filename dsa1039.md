# 1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon
You have a convex n-sided polygon where each vertex has an integer value. You are given an integer array values where values[i] is the value of the ith vertex in clockwise order.

Polygon triangulation is a process where you divide a polygon into a set of triangles and the vertices of each triangle must also be vertices of the original polygon. Note that no other shapes other than triangles are allowed in the division. This process will result in n - 2 triangles.

You will triangulate the polygon. For each triangle, the weight of that triangle is the product of the values at its vertices. The total score of the triangulation is the sum of these weights over all n - 2 triangles.

Return the minimum possible score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.

 

Example 1:


Input: values = [1,2,3]

Output: 6

Explanation: The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.

Example 2:


Input: values = [3,7,4,5]

Output: 144

Explanation: There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.
The minimum score is 144.

Example 3:


Input: values = [1,3,1,4,1,5]

Output: 13

Explanation: The minimum score triangulation is 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.

 

Constraints:

n == values.length
3 <= n <= 50
1 <= values[i] <= 100

1/ You have a convex polygon 🔺🔺🔺
Each vertex has a value.
When you divide it into triangles, each triangle’s score = product of its 3 vertices.

Goal: Minimize the total score after full triangulation.

2/ Key Insight 💡

A polygon with n vertices always forms n-2 triangles.

The order of dividing matters! Different triangulations = different total scores.

So we need the minimum possible sum of all triangle weights.

3/ Brute force ❌
Try all ways to triangulate → exponential blowup 😵

Instead…
Think: if I fix a triangle (i, j, k) inside the polygon → it splits the polygon into smaller ones.

4/ DP Formulation 🧩
Let dp[i][j] = minimum score for triangulating polygon between vertices i…j.

Transition:
Choose a middle point k between i and j.
Cost = dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[k] * values[j].

Take the minimum over all k.

5/ Build it up 🔨
Start with small polygons (length 3 = base triangle).
Expand gradually until full polygon is solved.

At the end → dp[0][n-1] gives the answer ✅

6/ Why it works 🤔

Each triangulation must pick one triangle (i, k, j) at a time.

DP ensures we combine optimal sub-triangulations.

Bottom-up guarantees we don’t recompute.

Time: O(n^3)
Space: O(n^2)
(Safe for n ≤ 50)

7/ Takeaway 🌟

            for (int i = 0; i + len - 1 < n; ++i) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                int best = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; ++k) {
                    int cost = dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[k] * values[j];
                    if (cost < best) best = cost;
                }
                dp[i][j] = best;
            }
        }
        return dp.empty() ? 0 : dp[0][n-1];
    }
