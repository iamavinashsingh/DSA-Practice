# 3508. Implement Router
Design a data structure that can efficiently manage data packets in a network router. Each data packet consists of the following attributes:

source: A unique identifier for the machine that generated the packet.
destination: A unique identifier for the target machine.
timestamp: The time at which the packet arrived at the router.
Implement the Router class:

Router(int memoryLimit): Initializes the Router object with a fixed memory limit.

memoryLimit is the maximum number of packets the router can store at any given time.
If adding a new packet would exceed this limit, the oldest packet must be removed to free up space.
bool addPacket(int source, int destination, int timestamp): Adds a packet with the given attributes to the router.

A packet is considered a duplicate if another packet with the same source, destination, and timestamp already exists in the router.
Return true if the packet is successfully added (i.e., it is not a duplicate); otherwise return false.
int[] forwardPacket(): Forwards the next packet in FIFO (First In First Out) order.

Remove the packet from storage.
Return the packet as an array [source, destination, timestamp].
If there are no packets to forward, return an empty array.
int getCount(int destination, int startTime, int endTime):

Returns the number of packets currently stored in the router (i.e., not yet forwarded) that have the specified destination and have timestamps in the inclusive range [startTime, endTime].
Note that queries for addPacket will be made in increasing order of timestamp.

 

Example 1:

Input:
["Router", "addPacket", "addPacket", "addPacket", "addPacket", "addPacket", "forwardPacket", "addPacket", "getCount"]
[[3], [1, 4, 90], [2, 5, 90], [1, 4, 90], [3, 5, 95], [4, 5, 105], [], [5, 2, 110], [5, 100, 110]]

Output:
[null, true, true, false, true, true, [2, 5, 90], true, 1]

Explanation

Router router = new Router(3); // Initialize Router with memoryLimit of 3.
router.addPacket(1, 4, 90); // Packet is added. Return True.
router.addPacket(2, 5, 90); // Packet is added. Return True.
router.addPacket(1, 4, 90); // This is a duplicate packet. Return False.
router.addPacket(3, 5, 95); // Packet is added. Return True
router.addPacket(4, 5, 105); // Packet is added, [1, 4, 90] is removed as number of packets exceeds memoryLimit. Return True.
router.forwardPacket(); // Return [2, 5, 90] and remove it from router.
router.addPacket(5, 2, 110); // Packet is added. Return True.
router.getCount(5, 100, 110); // The only packet with destination 5 and timestamp in the inclusive range [100, 110] is [4, 5, 105]. Return 1.
Example 2:

Input:
["Router", "addPacket", "forwardPacket", "forwardPacket"]
[[2], [7, 4, 90], [], []]

Output:
[null, true, [7, 4, 90], []]

Explanation

Router router = new Router(2); // Initialize Router with memoryLimit of 2.
router.addPacket(7, 4, 90); // Return True.
router.forwardPacket(); // Return [7, 4, 90].
router.forwardPacket(); // There are no packets left, return [].
 

Constraints:

2 <= memoryLimit <= 105
1 <= source, destination <= 2 * 105
1 <= timestamp <= 109
1 <= startTime <= endTime <= 109
At most 105 calls will be made to addPacket, forwardPacket, and getCount methods altogether.
queries for addPacket will be made in increasing order of timestamp.

Today’s LeetCode POTD: Implement Router 🌐
We need to design a data structure that manages network packets with:

source, destination, timestamp

Limited memory

FIFO forwarding

Here’s the breakdown 👇

2/
📦 Core Rules:

Memory Limit: Router can only hold a fixed number of packets.
→ If it’s full & a new packet arrives → remove the oldest one.

Duplicates: If the same (source, destination, timestamp) already exists → reject it.

3/
📤 Forwarding Rule:

Packets are forwarded in FIFO (First In, First Out) order.

Forwarding = remove it from memory & return its details.

If nothing left → return empty.

4/
📊 Counting Packets:
We can query → “How many packets with destination = X have timestamps in [startTime, endTime]?”
👉 Only counts packets still in memory.

5/
💡 Key Insights:

Use a queue to manage FIFO.

Use hashmaps to quickly check duplicates & count per destination.

Since addPacket queries are given in increasing timestamp, we can keep timestamps sorted for efficient range queries.

6/
Why I liked this problem:
✔️ Mix of DSA + System Design
✔️ Teaches how routers buffer & forward data
✔️ Involves duplicate handling, capacity control, and efficient queries

```cpp
class Router {
private:
    int size;
    unordered_map<long long, vector<int>> packets;
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> counts;
    queue<long long> q;

    long long encode(int source, int destination, int timestamp) {
        return ((long long)source << 40) | ((long long)destination << 20) | timestamp;
    }

    int lowerBound(vector<int>& list, int target) {
        return (int)(lower_bound(list.begin(), list.end(), target) - list.begin());
    }

    int upperBound(vector<int>& list, int target) {
        return (int)(upper_bound(list.begin(), list.end(), target) - list.begin());
    }

public:
    Router(int memoryLimit) {
        size = memoryLimit;
    }

    bool addPacket(int source, int destination, int timestamp) {
        long long key = encode(source, destination, timestamp);

        if (packets.find(key) != packets.end())
            return false;

        if ((int)packets.size() >= size)
            forwardPacket();

        packets[key] = {source, destination, timestamp};
        q.push(key);
        counts[destination].push_back(timestamp);

        return true;
    }

    vector<int> forwardPacket() {
        if (packets.empty()) return {};

        long long key = q.front();
        q.pop();

        vector<int> packet = packets[key];
        packets.erase(key);

        int dest = packet[1];
        counts[dest].erase(counts[dest].begin());  // remove earliest timestamp

        return packet;
    }

    int getCount(int destination, int startTime, int endTime) {
        auto it = counts.find(destination);
        if (it == counts.end() || it->second.empty())
            return 0;

        vector<int>& list = it->second;

        int left = lowerBound(list, startTime);
        int right = upperBound(list, endTime);

        return right - left;
    }
};
