# 3289. The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville
In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called nums containing integers from 0 to n - 1. Each number was supposed to appear exactly once in the list, however, two mischievous numbers sneaked in an additional time, making the list longer than usual.

As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an array of size two containing the two numbers (in any order), so peace can return to Digitville.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,0]

Output: [0,1]

Explanation:

The numbers 0 and 1 each appear twice in the array.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,2,1,3,2]

Output: [2,3]

Explanation:

The numbers 2 and 3 each appear twice in the array.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,1,5,4,3,4,6,0,9,5,8,2]

Output: [4,5]

Explanation:

The numbers 4 and 5 each appear twice in the array.

 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 100
nums.length == n + 2
0 <= nums[i] < n
The input is generated such that nums contains exactly two repeated elements.

Today's @LeetCode POTD — “The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville” 🔍

In Digitville, every number from 0 to n-1 was supposed to appear once…
but two sneaky numbers showed up twice! 😱

Let’s catch the culprits 👇

🎯 The goal:
Find which two numbers appear twice in the list.

Example:
[0,3,2,1,3,2] → the sneaky ones are 2 & 3 🕵️‍♂️

💡 Think simple — no need for fancy tricks!

We’ll just count how many times each number appears 👇
1️⃣ Create a list to store counts
2️⃣ Go through each number one by one
3️⃣ When a number’s count becomes 2 — boom 💥 found a sneaky number!

Tweet 4:
Let’s visualize 🧠

For [7,1,5,4,3,4,6,0,9,5,8,2]

→ as you go through:
4 shows up twice → first sneaky one
5 shows up twice → second sneaky one

Final answer → [4,5] ✅

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getSneakyNumbers(vector<int>& nums) 
    {
        vector<int> ans;
        vector<int> count(nums.size(), 0);

        for (int val : nums)
        {
            if (++count[val] == 2)
                ans.push_back(val);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
