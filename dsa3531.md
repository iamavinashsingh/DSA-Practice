# 3531. Count Covered Buildings
You are given a positive integer n, representing an n x n city. You are also given a 2D grid buildings, where buildings[i] = [x, y] denotes a unique building located at coordinates [x, y].

A building is covered if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.

Return the number of covered buildings.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Only building [2,2] is covered as it has at least one building:
above ([1,2])
below ([3,2])
left ([2,1])
right ([2,3])
Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
Example 2:



Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]

Output: 0

Explanation:

No building has at least one building in all four directions.
Example 3:



Input: n = 5, buildings = [[1,3],[3,2],[3,3],[3,5],[5,3]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

Only building [3,3] is covered as it has at least one building:
above ([1,3])
below ([5,3])
left ([3,2])
right ([3,5])
Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= buildings.length <= 10^5 
buildings[i] = [x, y]
1 <= x, y <= n
All coordinates of buildings are unique.

        for (auto &b : buildings) {
            rowMap[b[0]].push_back(b[1]);
            colMap[b[1]].push_back(b[0]);
        }

        int result = 0;

        for (auto &b : buildings) {
            int x = b[0], y = b[1];

            bool left = false, right = false;
            bool up = false, down = false;

            // Check row for left/right
            for (int col : rowMap[x]) {
                if (col < y) left = true;
                if (col > y) right = true;
            }

            // Check column for up/down
            for (int row : colMap[y]) {
                if (row < x) up = true;
                if (row > x) down = true;
            }

            if (left && right && up && down)
                result++;
        }

        return result;
    }
