# 2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions

You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.

You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.

Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.

 

Example 1:

Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
Output: [4,0,3]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
Example 2:

Input: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful. 
- 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful. 
Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.
 

Constraints:

n == spells.length
m == potions.length
1 <= n, m <= 105
1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 105
1 <= success <= 10^10

Today's @LeetCode POTD: Successful Pairs of Spells & Potions 🧙✨

We’re mixing spells & potions… but only the powerful combos succeed 💥
Let’s break it down in the simplest way 🧵👇
#DSA #LeetCode #100DaysOfCode

Tweet 2:
Setup:

Each spell has a strength

Each potion has a strength

A pair is successful if: spell × potion ≥ success

We need to find, for every spell → how many potions make it powerful enough? ⚡

Tweet 3 (Analogy):
Think of it like matchmaking 💕:

A spell (wizard) needs the right potion (partner)

Some wizards are strong → they can pair with almost anyone

Some are weak → they need a very strong potion to succeed 🌟

Tweet 4 (Key Insight):
Instead of brute forcing every combo (which would be too slow for large inputs 🚫),
we:

Sort the potions 🧪

For each spell, find the first potion strong enough

Every potion to the right of that is also valid ✅

Tweet 5 (Binary Search Magic 🪄):
Why binary search?

Potions are sorted

Once we find the smallest potion that works,
→ all stronger ones also work
→ count = total potions – index found 🧮

Tweet 6 (Visualization):
Example:
spells = [5,1,3]
potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7

Spell 5 → pairs with 4 potions

Spell 1 → 0 pairs

Spell 3 → 3 pairs

Answer = [4,0,3] ✨

Tweet 7 (Engagement):
Lesson: sometimes, the right sorting + binary search combo saves us from brute force chaos.
Just like in real life… choosing wisely saves time ⏳😅

Would you prefer me to do a visual graph-style breakdown next time?
