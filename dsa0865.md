Given the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.

Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.

A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.

The subtree of a node is a tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
Output: [2,7,4]
Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.
Notice that nodes 5, 3 and 2 contain the deepest nodes in the tree but node 2 is the smallest subtree among them, so we return it.
Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree.
Example 3:

Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The deepest node in the tree is 2, the valid subtrees are the subtrees of nodes 2, 1 and 0 but the subtree of node 2 is the smallest.
 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 500].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 500
- The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lca( TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q ) {
        if ( !root || root == p || root == q ) return root;
        TreeNode *left = lca( root->left, p, q );
        TreeNode *right = lca (root->right, p, q );

        return !left? right: !right? left: root;
    }
    
    TreeNode* subtreeWithAllDeepest(TreeNode* root) {
        if ( !root || !root->left && !root->right ) return root;
        TreeNode *leftMost = NULL;
        TreeNode *rightMost = NULL;
        
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        while( !q.empty() ) {
            int levelSize = q.size();
            for(int level = 0; level < levelSize; level++ ) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front(); q.pop();
                if ( level == 0 ) leftMost = node;
                if ( level == levelSize - 1 ) rightMost = node;
                
                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
                
            }
        }
        return lca( root, leftMost, rightMost );
    }
};
