# 2257. Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid
You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.

A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.

Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

 

Example 1:


Input: m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The guarded and unguarded cells are shown in red and green respectively in the above diagram.
There are a total of 7 unguarded cells, so we return 7.
Example 2:


Input: m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The unguarded cells are shown in green in the above diagram.
There are a total of 4 unguarded cells, so we return 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 105
2 <= m * n <= 105
1 <= guards.length, walls.length <= 5 * 104
2 <= guards.length + walls.length <= m * n
guards[i].length == walls[j].length == 2
0 <= rowi, rowj < m
0 <= coli, colj < n
All the positions in guards and walls are unique.# 2257. Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid

Today's @LeetCode POTD – "Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid" 🛡️

We’re given a grid with:

Guards 👮

Walls 🧱
Our task? Count how many empty cells are not watched by any guard.

Tweet 2:
💡 How guards see the grid?
A guard can look in 4 directions:
➡ Right
⬅ Left
⬆ Up
⬇ Down
But their view stops immediately if there is:
❌ A wall
❌ Another guard

Any cell they can see becomes “guarded”.

Tweet 3:
🧠 Simple Breakdown of the Solution:

First, mark all guard positions and walls on the grid.

Now, for every row:
→ Move left to right, then right to left.
→ If a guard is found, mark all the way until you hit a wall or another guard.

Repeat the same for every column (top to bottom, bottom to top).

Tweet 4:
Why 4 sweeps (→, ←, ↓, ↑)?
Because a guard can see in all 4 directions.
This way, we simulate their vision using just loops — no complex data structure needed.

Tweet 5:
✅ After marking all visible cells as “guarded”,
we simply count how many cells are still:

Empty

Not guarded

Not a wall / guard

That final count = answer 🎯
