# 611. Valid Triangle Number
Given an integer array nums, return the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Valid combinations are: 
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

1/
We’re given an array of side lengths.
Task → Count how many triplets form a valid triangle.

Rule reminder:
👉 In a triangle, sum of two smaller sides > largest side.

2/
Naive approach?
Check all triplets → O(n³).
Works for small inputs, but not scalable. 🚫

We need something smarter.

3/
💡 Trick: Sort the array first.
Now, for every triplet, the largest side will always be at the end of our selection.

So the triangle condition reduces to:
nums[left] + nums[right] > nums[i]

4/
Use two pointers:

Fix the largest side at index i

Start with left = 0 and right = i-1

If condition holds → all elements between left and right can form valid triangles.

Else → move left ahead.

5/
Result → O(n²) solution.
Way faster than brute force and works for up to 1000 elements easily. ⚡

6/
✨ Key insight:
Sorting reduces the 3-side check to a 2-pointer sliding window problem.
Triangle inequality simplified beautifully.

7/
That’s #611 done ✅
Another classic example of combining sorting + two pointers to crack a geometry-based problem.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int triangleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 1; i--) {
            int left = 0, right = i - 1;
            while (left < right) {
                if (nums[left] + nums[right] > nums[i]) {
                    count += right - left;
                    right--;
                } else {
                    left++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
