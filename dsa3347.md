 # 3347. Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations II
You are given an integer array nums and two integers k and numOperations.

You must perform an operation numOperations times on nums, where in each operation you:

Select an index i that was not selected in any previous operations.
Add an integer in the range [-k, k] to nums[i].
Return the maximum possible frequency of any element in nums after performing the operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

Adding 0 to nums[1], after which nums becomes [1, 4, 5].
Adding -1 to nums[2], after which nums becomes [1, 4, 4].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,11,20,20], k = 5, numOperations = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

Adding 0 to nums[1].
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
0 <= k <= 10^9
0 <= numOperations <= nums.length

Today’s @LeetCode POTD is 3347: Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations II 🔢✨

We can tweak each element slightly numOperations times, and the goal is to make one number appear as many times as possible 💡
Let’s break it down 🧵👇
#LeetCode #DSA #100DaysOfCode

Tweet 2 (Problem story):
Given an array nums, a number k, and numOperations:

Each operation lets us add/subtract up to k to one element

You can use each index only once
Goal: maximize the frequency of any number 🔢

It’s like leveling up numbers to form a “crowd favorite”! 😎

Tweet 3 (Example time):
nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2

Add 0 to 4 → still 4

Add -1 to 5 → becomes 4
Now 4 appears twice → max frequency = 2 ✅

Tweet 4 (Core intuition):
Think of it like grouping numbers together:

We can slightly adjust numbers within ±k

Operations = your “moves” to merge numbers

Max frequency = largest group we can form using moves ✨

Tweet 5 (Strategy simplified):
Step-by-step logic:

Sort the numbers

Slide a “window” of numbers you can adjust into each other

Use numOperations wisely to merge numbers within ±k

Track the largest group formed → that’s your max frequency 🚀

Tweet 6 (Why it works):
Sorting + sliding window lets us see which numbers can cluster together easily.

No wasted moves, no random adjustments — every operation counts ✅

Tweet 7 (Analogy):
Imagine a party 🎉

Each guest = a number

You can convince a few guests (±k) to wear the same color

Max frequency = biggest group in the same color 🎨
Plan wisely → largest “crowd” forms! 🥳

                right1++;
            }
            maxFreq =
                max(maxFreq, sameValueCount + min(windowCount1 - sameValueCount,numOperations));
            windowCount2++;
            while (nums[left2] < num - 2 * k) {
                windowCount2--;
                left2++;
            }
            maxFreq = max(maxFreq, min(windowCount2, numOperations));
        }

        return maxFreq;
    }
