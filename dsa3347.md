 # 3347. Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations II
You are given an integer array nums and two integers k and numOperations.

You must perform an operation numOperations times on nums, where in each operation you:

Select an index i that was not selected in any previous operations.
Add an integer in the range [-k, k] to nums[i].
Return the maximum possible frequency of any element in nums after performing the operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

Adding 0 to nums[1], after which nums becomes [1, 4, 5].
Adding -1 to nums[2], after which nums becomes [1, 4, 4].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,11,20,20], k = 5, numOperations = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

Adding 0 to nums[1].
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
0 <= k <= 10^9
0 <= numOperations <= nums.length

                max(maxFreq, sameValueCount + min(windowCount1 - sameValueCount,numOperations));
            windowCount2++;
            while (nums[left2] < num - 2 * k) {
