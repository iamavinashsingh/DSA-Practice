# 778. Swim in Rising Water
You are given an n x n integer matrix grid where each value grid[i][j] represents the elevation at that point (i, j).

It starts raining, and water gradually rises over time. At time t, the water level is t, meaning any cell with elevation less than equal to t is submerged or reachable.

You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return the minimum time until you can reach the bottom right square (n - 1, n - 1) if you start at the top left square (0, 0).

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 50
0 <= grid[i][j] < n2
Each value grid[i][j] is unique.

Tweet 1 (Hook):
🌊 Imagine being stuck in a city where water keeps rising…
You start at the top-left corner & need to reach the bottom-right corner.
When’s the earliest time you can swim there safely?
That’s today’s LeetCode POTD: Swim in Rising Water (778) 🧵
#LeetCode #DSA #100DaysOfCode

Tweet 2:
The challenge:

Each cell has a unique elevation.

Water level = time.

At time t, you can only move on cells ≤ t.

Goal: find the minimum t when start (0,0) connects to end (n-1,n-1).

Sounds simple, but tricky when the grid is full of ups & downs.

Tweet 3 (Analogy):
Think of it like waiting for flood water to rise 🌧️:
➡️ You can only swim into streets submerged under water.
➡️ The higher the wall, the longer you must wait.
➡️ The path is possible once all barriers along your route are underwater.

Tweet 4:
How do we solve it? Two key insights:

The problem is about finding the minimum elevation barrier on a path.

If water level ≥ that barrier, the path is open.

So basically → minimize the maximum height you must cross.

Tweet 5:
One smart way: Binary Search on Time + DFS/BFS ⏳

Guess a water level t.

Check if you can swim from start to end when water = t.

If yes → try lower. If no → wait longer.
This narrows down the exact minimum time.

Tweet 6:
Alternative (also common):
Use a Min-Heap (Dijkstra style).

Always expand the lowest elevation cell reachable.

Keep track of the max elevation seen so far = water level needed.

Once you reach the target cell → that’s your answer.

Tweet 7 (Engagement):
Example:

In grid [[0,2],[1,3]], you wait till t=3.

In the bigger grid with highs & lows, answer = 16.

Do you also visualize it like water slowly flooding a maze? 🌊😅

Tweet 8 (Closing):
✨ Key takeaway:
Don’t just look at when you can move → look at the worst block on the best path.
That block decides the time you must wait.

Would you like me to make a thread comparing this to Trapping Rain Water II (407)? Both are “water + grid” problems but with very different twists. 🤔💧
