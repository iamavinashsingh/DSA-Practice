# 3650. Minimum Cost Path with Edge Reversals


You are given a directed, weighted graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] represents a directed edge from node ui to node vi with cost wi.

Each node ui has a switch that can be used at most once: when you arrive at ui and have not yet used its switch, you may activate it on one of its incoming edges vi → ui reverse that edge to ui → vi and immediately traverse it.

The reversal is only valid for that single move, and using a reversed edge costs 2 * wi.

Return the minimum total cost to travel from node 0 to node n - 1. If it is not possible, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[3,1,1],[2,3,4],[0,2,2]]

Output: 5

Explanation:



Use the path 0 → 1 (cost 3).
At node 1 reverse the original edge 3 → 1 into 1 → 3 and traverse it at cost 2 * 1 = 2.
Total cost is 3 + 2 = 5.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,3,1],[2,3,3]]

Output: 3

Explanation:

No reversal is needed. Take the path 0 → 2 (cost 1), then 2 → 1 (cost 1), then 1 → 3 (cost 1).
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 5 * 104
1 <= edges.length <= 105
edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]
0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
1 <= wi <= 1000
