# 3346. Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations I
You are given an integer array nums and two integers k and numOperations.

You must perform an operation numOperations times on nums, where in each operation you:

Select an index i that was not selected in any previous operations.
Add an integer in the range [-k, k] to nums[i].
Return the maximum possible frequency of any element in nums after performing the operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

Adding 0 to nums[1]. nums becomes [1, 4, 5].
Adding -1 to nums[2]. nums becomes [1, 4, 4].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,11,20,20], k = 5, numOperations = 1

Output: 2

Explanation:

We can achieve a maximum frequency of two by:

Adding 0 to nums[1].
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
0 <= k <= 10^5
0 <= numOperations <= nums.length

---
Imagine you have an array like [1, 4, 5], and you’re allowed to add or subtract up to k from a few numbers.
Your goal? Make as many elements equal as possible 🔁

You can only do this numOperations times (so choose wisely 👀).

💡 Core Idea:
Each number can move within a range — from [num - k, num + k].
If ranges of different numbers overlap, that means they can become the same value!

So we want to find the value that overlaps with the most ranges ✨

🧠 Strategy in plain words:
1️⃣ Sort the numbers.
2️⃣ For each possible target value, find how many numbers can reach it (within ±k).
3️⃣ Use operations only where needed — up to numOperations.
4️⃣ Keep track of the maximum frequency you can achieve.

🔍 Example:
nums = [1,4,5], k = 1, numOperations = 2

→ 1 can reach [0,2]
→ 4 can reach [3,5]
→ 5 can reach [4,6]

If we push 5 → 4, now [4,4,1] ⇒ max frequency = 2 🎯

💬 In essence:
We’re sliding value ranges and checking how many overlap — and with limited moves, we pick the best spot to “gather” them all together.

Beautiful mix of binary search + greedy logic ❤️

🔥 Takeaway:
This problem trains your intuition on:

Thinking in ranges instead of fixed numbers

Understanding how flexibility changes frequency

Combining sorting and window-based logic effectively

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFrequency(vector<int>& nums, int k, int numOperations) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans = 0;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        for(int x : nums) freq[x]++;
        int mx = nums[n - 1];

        for(int val = 0; val <= mx; val++) {
// consider we are converging max possible elements to value = val, and we will check for each value from 0 to max element
            int lb = lower_bound(nums.begin(), nums.end(), val - k) - nums.begin();
            int ub = upper_bound(nums.begin(), nums.end(), val + k) - nums.begin() - 1;

            int cnt = freq[val] + min(ub - lb + 1 - freq[val], numOperations);
            ans = max(ans, cnt);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```
