# 2353. Design a Food Rating System

Design a food rating system that can do the following:

Modify the rating of a food item listed in the system.
Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.
Implement the FoodRatings class:

FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings) Initializes the system. The food items are described by foods, cuisines and ratings, all of which have a length of n.
foods[i] is the name of the ith food,
cuisines[i] is the type of cuisine of the ith food, and
ratings[i] is the initial rating of the ith food.
void changeRating(String food, int newRating) Changes the rating of the food item with the name food.
String highestRated(String cuisine) Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of cuisine. If there is a tie, return the item with the lexicographically smaller name.
Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.

Example 1:

Input
["FoodRatings", "highestRated", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated", "changeRating", "highestRated"]
[[["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]], ["korean"], ["japanese"], ["sushi", 16], ["japanese"], ["ramen", 16], ["japanese"]]
Output
[null, "kimchi", "ramen", null, "sushi", null, "ramen"]

Explanation
FoodRatings foodRatings = new FoodRatings(["kimchi", "miso", "sushi", "moussaka", "ramen", "bulgogi"], ["korean", "japanese", "japanese", "greek", "japanese", "korean"], [9, 12, 8, 15, 14, 7]);
foodRatings.highestRated("korean"); // return "kimchi"
                                    // "kimchi" is the highest rated korean food with a rating of 9.
foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen"
                                      // "ramen" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 14.
foodRatings.changeRating("sushi", 16); // "sushi" now has a rating of 16.
foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "sushi"
                                      // "sushi" is the highest rated japanese food with a rating of 16.
foodRatings.changeRating("ramen", 16); // "ramen" now has a rating of 16.
foodRatings.highestRated("japanese"); // return "ramen"
                                      // Both "sushi" and "ramen" have a rating of 16.
                                      // However, "ramen" is lexicographically smaller than "sushi".

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 2 * 104
n == foods.length == cuisines.length == ratings.length
1 <= foods[i].length, cuisines[i].length <= 10
foods[i], cuisines[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
1 <= ratings[i] <= 108
All the strings in foods are distinct.
food will be the name of a food item in the system across all calls to changeRating.
cuisine will be a type of cuisine of at least one food item in the system across all calls to highestRated.
At most 2 * 104 calls in total will be made to changeRating and highestRated.

Today’s LeetCode POTD: Design a Food Ratings System 🍲⭐
We need to:

Track foods, their cuisines, & ratings

Update ratings dynamically

Always query the highest-rated food per cuisine

Here’s how I broke it down 👇

2/
👉 We’re given three inputs:

foods[] → list of food items

cuisines[] → cuisine type of each food

ratings[] → current rating of each food

Operations:

changeRating(food, newRating)

highestRated(cuisine)

3/
💡 The real challenge:
When ratings change, we must efficiently update & still fetch the highest-rated food instantly.

And if two foods have the same rating → pick the one that’s lexicographically smaller (alphabetical order).

4/
⚙️ My approach:

Map each food → its cuisine

Map each food → its rating

For each cuisine, maintain a sorted set of foods, ordered by:

Higher rating first

Then lexicographically smaller name

5/
When rating changes:

Remove that food from its cuisine set

Update rating

Re-insert it → set automatically reorders ✅

When querying:

Just return the first element of the cuisine’s set → guaranteed highest rated.

6/
⏱️ Complexity:

Updating a rating = O(log n) (set insertion/removal)

Querying highest rated = O(1) (just pick first element)

Efficient enough even for large input sizes 🚀

7/
This problem is a mix of:

HashMaps (fast lookups)

Ordered Sets (maintain sorted order)

Custom comparators

It’s a great exercise in data structure design 💡
