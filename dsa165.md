# 165. Compare Version Numbers
Given two version strings, version1 and version2, compare them. A version string consists of revisions separated by dots '.'. The value of the revision is its integer conversion ignoring leading zeros.

To compare version strings, compare their revision values in left-to-right order. If one of the version strings has fewer revisions, treat the missing revision values as 0.

Return the following:

If version1 < version2, return -1.
If version1 > version2, return 1.
Otherwise, return 0.
 

Example 1:

Input: version1 = "1.2", version2 = "1.10"

Output: -1

Explanation:

version1's second revision is "2" and version2's second revision is "10": 2 < 10, so version1 < version2.

Example 2:

Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"

Output: 0

Explanation:

Ignoring leading zeroes, both "01" and "001" represent the same integer "1".

Example 3:

Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0.0"

Output: 0

Explanation:

version1 has less revisions, which means every missing revision are treated as "0".

 

Constraints:

1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500
version1 and version2 only contain digits and '.'.
version1 and version2 are valid version numbers.
All the given revisions in version1 and version2 can be stored in a 32-bit integer.

## LeetCode POTD 🎯
165. Compare Version Numbers
At first glance, it looks like a simple string comparison… but it’s trickier than that 👀
Here’s the breakdown 🧵👇

## 2
A version string looks like:
1.2.3 or 1.10 or 1.01.0

👉 Each part between dots . is called a revision.
👉 Revisions are compared as integers (ignoring leading zeros).
👉 Missing revisions = treated as 0.

## 3 (Example 1)
version1 = "1.2"
version2 = "1.10"

Compare left to right:

First revision: 1 vs 1 → equal

Second revision: 2 vs 10 → 2 < 10

So → version1 < version2 ✅ → answer = -1

##  4 (Example 2)
version1 = "1.01"
version2 = "1.001"

Ignore leading zeros → both are just 1.
All revisions equal → answer = 0 ✅

## 5 (Example 3)
version1 = "1.0"
version2 = "1.0.0.0"

Extra missing revisions treated as 0 → equal.
Answer = 0 ✅

##  6 (Intuition 🤔)
The trick is simple:

Split both versions into parts (by .).

Compare numbers one by one.

If one version runs out of parts → fill with 0.

First difference decides the result.

## 7 (Closing 🚀)

This problem shows how tiny details (like leading zeros or missing revisions) can break naive solutions. Careful parsing wins the game 💡

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int compareVersion(string version1, string version2) {
        int i1 = 0, i2 = 0;
        int n1 = version1.size(), n2 = version2.size();

        while (i1 < n1 || i2 < n2) {
            int j1 = i1;
            while (j1 < n1 && version1[j1] != '.') ++j1;
            int j2 = i2;
            while (j2 < n2 && version2[j2] != '.') ++j2;

            int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
            if (i1 < n1) num1 = stoi(version1.substr(i1, j1 - i1));
            if (i2 < n2) num2 = stoi(version2.substr(i2, j2 - i2));

            if (num1 < num2) return -1;
            if (num1 > num2) return 1;

            i1 = j1 + 1;
            i2 = j2 + 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
