# 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle
Given an integer array nums, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can form a triangle with three side lengths: 1, 2, and 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 2 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 1, and 10 to form a triangle.
You cannot use the side lengths 1, 2, and 10 to form a triangle.
As we cannot use any three side lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area, we return 0.
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 106

Tweet 1 (Hook):
🔺 Today’s #LeetCode POTD was about Triangles.
The challenge? From an array of numbers (side lengths), find the largest perimeter triangle that can actually exist.
Sounds easy? Let’s break it down 👇 #100DaysOfCode #dsa

Tweet 2 (Core Idea):
A triangle is only valid if the sum of any two sides > the third side.
👉 So the trick is:

Sort the sides (biggest to smallest).

Pick the largest 3 numbers & check validity.

If not valid, move to the next 3.

Tweet 3 (Intuition):
Why sort?
Because the largest perimeter will always involve the biggest sides.
So instead of checking all triplets (which is costly), we just move from the biggest downwards.

Tweet 4 (Example):
nums = [2,1,2]
Sorted → [2,2,1]
Check: 2 < 2+1 ✅ valid!
Perimeter = 2+2+1 = 5 🎉

nums = [1,2,1,10]
Largest combos all fail ❌ → Answer = 0.

Tweet 5 (Wrap-up):
This problem is a beautiful reminder that:
👉 Sorting often simplifies greedy problems.
👉 Math rules (like triangle inequality) can cut down brute force.

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int largestPerimeter(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.rbegin(), nums.rend());
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 2; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i+1] + nums[i+2]) {
                return nums[i] + nums[i+1] + nums[i+2];
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};

```
