# 2221. Find Triangular Sum of an Array
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] is a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

The triangular sum of nums is the value of the only element present in nums after the following process terminates:

Let nums comprise of n elements. If n == 1, end the process. Otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array newNums of length n - 1.
For each index i, where 0 <= i < n - 1, assign the value of newNums[i] as (nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10, where % denotes modulo operator.
Replace the array nums with newNums.
Repeat the entire process starting from step 1.
Return the triangular sum of nums.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 8
Explanation:
The above diagram depicts the process from which we obtain the triangular sum of the array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Since there is only one element in nums, the triangular sum is the value of that element itself.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 9

Tweet 1 (Hook):
🚀 Today’s #LeetCode POTD is Triangular Sum of an Array.
At first, it looks like a tough iterative problem… but if you zoom out 👀, the solution is actually super intuitive.
Let’s break it down step by step 🧵👇

Tweet 2 (Setup):
You’re given an array of digits (0–9).
👉 Repeatedly replace it by summing adjacent elements & taking last digit (%10).
👉 Stop when only ONE number remains.
That’s your Triangular Sum 🎯.

Tweet 3 (Example):
Example: [1,2,3,4,5]
Step 1 → [3,5,7,9] → [3,5,7,9] %10 = [3,5,7,9]
Step 2 → [8,2,6]
Step 3 → [0,8]
Step 4 → [8] ✅ Final Answer = 8

Notice the triangle collapsing effect? 🔻

Tweet 4 (Intuition):
Instead of building the whole triangle, we can just update the array in place at each step:

Replace nums[i] with (nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10.

Shrink array size until 1 element left.

Simple, clean, O(n²) → still fine for n ≤ 1000.

Tweet 5 (Engagement):
This problem looks scary… but the trick is:
👉 Don’t overthink.
👉 Just simulate the process step by step.
👉 Update the array until only one number remains.

It’s like watching a pyramid collapse into a single stone 🔻💎

Tweet 6 (Closing + CTA):
✅ Key takeaway: Sometimes brute-force simulation is exactly what’s expected.
Not every problem hides a scary math trick 😉

```cpp
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int triangularSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        for (int size = n; size > 1; --size) {
            for (int i = 0; i < size -1; ++i) {
                nums[i] = (nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10;
            }
        }
        return nums[0];
    }
};
