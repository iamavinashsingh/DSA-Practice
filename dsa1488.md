# 1488. Avoid Flood in The City
Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake that is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid floods in any lake.

Given an integer array rains where:

rains[i] > 0 means there will be rains over the rains[i] lake.
rains[i] == 0 means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.
Return an array ans where:

ans.length == rains.length
ans[i] == -1 if rains[i] > 0.
ans[i] is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if rains[i] == 0.
If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes.

 

Example 1:

Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.
Example 2:

Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.
After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].
After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].
It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.
Example 3:

Input: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]
Output: []
Explanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.
After that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.
 

Constraints:

1 <= rains.length <= 10^5
0 <= rains[i] <= 10^9

Tweet 1 (Hook):
🌧️ Imagine a city with infinite lakes… but every time it rains, lakes fill up.
If a full lake rains again → FLOOD! 😱
How do you avoid floods?
LeetCode #1488 makes us think like city planners 🏙️💧
Let’s break it down 🧵
#DSA #LeetCode #100DaysOfCode

Tweet 2:
Here’s the scenario:

rains[i] > 0 → lake i gets full

rains[i] == 0 → dry any lake you want
Goal: Never let a lake flood. Easy? Not really… 🤯

Tweet 3 (Analogy):
Think of it like parking lots:

Rain = a car comes in → fill a parking spot

0 = empty day → you can remove a car to prevent congestion
If you pick wrong → a car has nowhere to park → disaster 😅

Tweet 4 (Core Idea):
Key insight:

Keep track of which lakes are full

When it rains on a lake that’s already full, we must have dried it earlier

So, zero days are precious → use them strategically

Tweet 5 (Strategy):
Step-by-step:

Track all full lakes

For each rain, check if lake is already full

If yes → find the earliest zero day after last rain to dry it

If no such zero day → flood is unavoidable 🚨

Tweet 6 (Visualization):
Example: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]

Day 1 → lake 1 full

Day 2 → lake 2 full

Day 3 → dry lake 2

Day 4 → dry lake 1

Day 5-6 → rains fill lakes again safely ✅
See? Proper planning saves the city 🌆

Tweet 7 (Engagement):
The lesson?
It’s all about timing & planning.
Zero days are like cheat codes – use them wisely, or the city floods 😎💡
Do you also imagine lakes and rain when solving these problems? 😂

Tweet 8 (Closing):
So #DSA isn’t just arrays & maps…
It’s strategic thinking in disguise!
Next time it rains, think: “Which lake should I dry?” 🌧️🏞️
