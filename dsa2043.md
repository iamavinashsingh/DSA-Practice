# 2043. Simple Bank System
You have been tasked with writing a program for a popular bank that will automate all its incoming transactions (transfer, deposit, and withdraw). The bank has n accounts numbered from 1 to n. The initial balance of each account is stored in a 0-indexed integer array balance, with the (i + 1)th account having an initial balance of balance[i].

Execute all the valid transactions. A transaction is valid if:

The given account number(s) are between 1 and n, and
The amount of money withdrawn or transferred from is less than or equal to the balance of the account.
Implement the Bank class:

Bank(long[] balance) Initializes the object with the 0-indexed integer array balance.
boolean transfer(int account1, int account2, long money) Transfers money dollars from the account numbered account1 to the account numbered account2. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.
boolean deposit(int account, long money) Deposit money dollars into the account numbered account. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.
boolean withdraw(int account, long money) Withdraw money dollars from the account numbered account. Return true if the transaction was successful, false otherwise.
 

Example 1:

Input
["Bank", "withdraw", "transfer", "deposit", "transfer", "withdraw"]
[[[10, 100, 20, 50, 30]], [3, 10], [5, 1, 20], [5, 20], [3, 4, 15], [10, 50]]
Output
[null, true, true, true, false, false]

Explanation
Bank bank = new Bank([10, 100, 20, 50, 30]);
bank.withdraw(3, 10);    // return true, account 3 has a balance of $20, so it is valid to withdraw $10.
                         // Account 3 has $20 - $10 = $10.
bank.transfer(5, 1, 20); // return true, account 5 has a balance of $30, so it is valid to transfer $20.
                         // Account 5 has $30 - $20 = $10, and account 1 has $10 + $20 = $30.
bank.deposit(5, 20);     // return true, it is valid to deposit $20 to account 5.
                         // Account 5 has $10 + $20 = $30.
bank.transfer(3, 4, 15); // return false, the current balance of account 3 is $10,
                         // so it is invalid to transfer $15 from it.
bank.withdraw(10, 50);   // return false, it is invalid because account 10 does not exist.
 

Constraints:

n == balance.length
1 <= n, account, account1, account2 <= 10^5
0 <= balance[i], money <= 10^12
At most 10^4 calls will be made to each function transfer, deposit, withdraw.

## Today's @LeetCode POTD — “Simple Bank System” 🏦

We built our own mini bank that handles deposits, withdrawals, and transfers 💰
Let’s understand how this works step-by-step (no finance degree needed 😆👇)

### 2:
Imagine you’re running a bank.
You’ve got n accounts — each with some balance 💵

Now the system needs to do 3 things safely:
1️⃣ Deposit money to an account
2️⃣ Withdraw money from it
3️⃣ Transfer money between 2 accounts

Sounds easy? Let’s make it work logically 👇

### 3:
💡 First rule — every transaction must be valid:
✔️ Account numbers should exist
✔️ You can’t take out more than what’s in the account

If either rule breaks ❌ → the transaction fails!
Otherwise ✅ it goes through successfully.

### 4:
Here’s how the idea works in plain logic 👇
➡️ Store all balances in a list 📋
➡️ When you withdraw — just subtract from that account
➡️ When you deposit — add to it
➡️ When you transfer — subtract from sender, add to receiver

That’s the whole magic ✨

### 5:
🧠 The trickiest part?
Checking validity before touching any money 💸

So before every operation, we ask:

“Does this account exist?”
“Does it have enough balance?”

Only if both are true → do the transaction safely ✅

### 6:
This problem is a perfect example of OOP thinking 💭
We wrapped all 3 features inside a single Bank class,
so each account behaves just like in a real system 🔐

No complex math. No fancy DS.
Just clear logic + structure.

###  7 (Closing):
Result ✅
A simple, clean simulation that’s beginner-friendly yet production-like 🧱

Leetcode #2043 solved!
Concepts: Simulation + Validation + OOP

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Bank {
private:
    vector<long long> balance;  // Stores balances for all accounts
    int totalAccounts;          // Number of accounts

    // Check if an account number is valid
    bool isValid(int account) {
        return account >= 1 && account <= totalAccounts;
    }

public:
    // Constructor: initialize the bank with given balances
    Bank(vector<long long>& initialBalances) {
        balance = initialBalances;
        totalAccounts = balance.size();
    }

    // Transfer money from one account to another
    bool transfer(int from, int to, long long amount) {
        if (!isValid(from) || !isValid(to)) return false;    // Invalid account numbers
        if (balance[from - 1] < amount) return false;        // Not enough money
        balance[from - 1] -= amount;                         // Take from sender
        balance[to - 1] += amount;                           // Give to receiver
        return true;
    }

    // Deposit money into an account
    bool deposit(int account, long long amount) {
        if (!isValid(account)) return false;                 // Invalid account
        balance[account - 1] += amount;                      // Add money
        return true;
    }

    // Withdraw money from an account
    bool withdraw(int account, long long amount) {
        if (!isValid(account)) return false;                 // Invalid account
        if (balance[account - 1] < amount) return false;     // Not enough money
        balance[account - 1] -= amount;                      // Subtract money
        return true;
    }
};
