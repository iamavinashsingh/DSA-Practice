# 812. Largest Triangle Area
Given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any three different points. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

Example 1:


Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: The five points are shown in the above figure. The red triangle is the largest.
Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,0],[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 0.50000
 

Constraints:

3 <= points.length <= 50
-50 <= xi, yi <= 50
All the given points are unique.

Tweet 1 (Hook):
Geometry meets coding 🌀
Today’s #LeetCode POTD was about finding the largest triangle area you can form from given points on a plane. Sounds simple, but it needs a neat trick! Let’s break it down ⬇️

Tweet 2 (Problem in simple words):
We’re given coordinates of points.
Pick any 3 points → they form a triangle.
Question: What’s the area of the biggest triangle possible?

Tweet 3 (Key Insight):
To find the area of a triangle from 3 points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), we use this shoelace formula 👇

Area = 0.5 * | x1(y2−y3) + x2(y3−y1) + x3(y1−y2) |

No trigonometry, just pure coordinate geometry ❤️

Tweet 4 (Approach):

Loop through all triplets of points.

Compute triangle area using the formula.

Keep track of the maximum area found.

Since max points ≤ 50 → brute force (n³) works fine ✅

Tweet 5 (Conclusion):
That’s it! Simple geometry + iteration.
Final answer: maximum area among all triplets.

Sometimes brute force + the right formula is all you need 😉

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    double largestTriangleArea(vector<vector<int>>& p) {
        int n = p.size();
        double ans = 0.0;
        for(int i=0;i<n-2;i++){
            double x1=p[i][0], y1=p[i][1];
            for(int j=i+1;j<n-1;j++){
                double x2=p[j][0], y2=p[j][1];
                for(int k=j+1;k<n;k++){
                    double x3=p[k][0], y3=p[k][1];
                    double area=0.5*abs(x1*(y2-y3)+x2*(y3-y1)+x3*(y1-y2));
                    ans=max(ans,area);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

```
